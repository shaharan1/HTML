      The IsDB-BISEW IT Scholarship Project has been rated by a Third-Party
      Evaluation as "Really appreciable and praiseworthy contribution towards
      the economy or Bangladesh and underprivileged Muslim Youths and strongly
      recommended for continuing tne program ln broader and extended domain".
      The IsDB-BISEW IT Scholarship Project, as stated in the BUET Evaluation
      report -"The IsDB-BISEW IT Scholarship Project has been producing highly
      competent Il workforce for the job market. The evaluation of the project
      reveals that the qualifications and competencies obtained by completion of
      the training are officially authorized through the lDB-Bl1SEW certificate
      and vendor certifications both of which are non-academic in nature. Rather
      a professional certification/diploma from an academic institution and/or
      accreditation from an authorized educational body will add more value both
      for the trainees and the project. This evaluation, therefore, strongly
      recommends that the IsDB-BISEW IT Scholarship Project undertake the
      necessary steps to seek endorsement of its training program from a
      suitable educational body authorized to confer such qualification"; and
      The IsDB-BISEW Madrasah Project has been rated in a Third-Party evaluation
      in the following terms- "The initiative of undertaking Madrasah project
      and introducing Dakhil (Vocational) program is highly appreciable and its
      close monitoring system is ensuring quality education"
